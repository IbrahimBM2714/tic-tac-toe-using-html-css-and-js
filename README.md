The inspiration behind this project came from an AI lab we did where we created adversarial tic tac toe. I used the same procedure and turned that Python program into an interactive game.

If you want to experience this for yourself, you can do so by downloading the code and running the website on your browser using the Live Server extension. For those of you who don't know about Live Server, it is an extension that can be downloaded inside of Vscode.

This is what your bottom bar of vs code will look like if you have successfully installed the extension. Now all you have to do is click on Go Live and your website will be launched on your browser.
